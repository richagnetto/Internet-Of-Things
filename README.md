Lab 1: Uses Google Voice-to-Speech API to understand the user's command and converts the response into a string of letters.
       According to whether the user has requested Temperature or Humidity, acess the value from the sensor and display it on the LCD.
       
Lab 2: Utilise the previous code to control a robotic arm using a coordinate system and commands such as left, right, up and down. 
       We can also open or close the gripper on the robotic arm or print Temperature or Humidity if the user requests for it.
       After converting the command to text, the action is performed and printed on the LCD display.
       
Lab 3: Display the temperature and humidity as line charts using Google Charts over time by reading sensor data and pushing the information on to 
       the Azure cloud database. The results are displayed on the website that connects the Azure database and web server.
